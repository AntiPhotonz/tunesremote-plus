= Connection Problems FAQ=

If you are having trouble with TunesRemote+ connecting please follow this document for potential problems.


= Details =

==Firewall, Firewall, Firewall...==

99.9% of problems connecting are related to your firewall.  Either in your Operating System firewall or in your router firewall.  I have had many users tell me "it's not my firewall I checked", and then after further debugging it turned out it was their firewall.

I beg you to read this Apple Support FAQ before saying its not your firewall:

http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1741

Still think its not your firewall?   Make sure the following Ports are allowed in all Virus Scanners, Firewalls, Spyware, Defenders etc.  Norton, Macafee, AVG, Avast, etc etc etc...

  * TCP 3689
  * TCP 1024
  * UDP 5353

==WIFI Connection==

Another common problem is users don't realize their Android device needs to be on the *SAME* WIFI connection as their server.   Sometimes they are accidentally connected to a neighbor's WIFI network, sometimes they are accidentally using their Android 3G connection.

I will guarantee you will not get TunesRemote+ to work unless both the Android and Server app are on the same WIFI network.
