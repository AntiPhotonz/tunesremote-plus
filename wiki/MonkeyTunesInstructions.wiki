1. Install the latest [http://www.mediamonkey.com/ MediaMonkey from Ventis Media].  Make sure at the end of the install to say YES when asked to run MediaMonkey.  This is important because the Installer runs as Administrator and installs the COM SDK that MonkeyTunes uses.  If you don't say yes you will get COM errors in the MonkeyTunes log.
